## 🌟 Features

- **AI-Powered Workflows**: Automated tasks and intelligent integrations using **n8n**.
- **Modern Backend**: Built with **Nest.js** for a scalable and maintainable architecture.
- **Database Management**: Utilizes **PostgreSQL** with **Prisma ORM** for type-safe database interactions.
- **Cloud Backend**: Powered by **Supabase** for authentication, real-time databases, and serverless functions.
- **Responsive Frontend**: *(To be decided – React/Vue/Angular/Svelte)*.
